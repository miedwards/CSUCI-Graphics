We have a problem due next week. It is to model a sphere. We should describe 3
methods. The three methods are sphereical coordinate interpolation, tetrahedron
subdivision, and manifold curve parameterization. We are to submit code for
spherical coordinate interpolation only, but to submit diagrams for all of them.
