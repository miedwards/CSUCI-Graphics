Review the way shaders are implemented on the GPU . Remember the Vertex shader,
the PA, the Clip, the Rasterization, the F shader. We do our work in normalized
device coordinates. OpenGL uses the LEFT hand rule. This means the depth is into
the screen. We will reverse this when we use OpenGL. The rasterizer converts the
points in normalized device coordinates into points on the the screen. At this
point we will consider drawing a cube in opengl. We will triangulate the cube,
into 38 verticies. 

Take a look at translation, rotation and scaling transformations if I have
nothing better to do... Though it isn't a bad idea to learn this for next time.

Tests will involve the graphics pipeline, transformations on points, the
matricies. What is done where in the pipeline, and what does each component do?
