Physically Based Animation

Key frame animation

Artists will draw frames called "Key Frames" that
the computer will then interpolate in order to animate.
This is often touched up afterwards

Motion Capture

Actors will wear suits with points that sensors can detect.
This is used to animate difficult to replicate motions like
facial expressions. This takes a lot of computing power.

Physically-Based Animation

We replicate natural forces and use mathematics to animate.

F = MA
Point Mass
Constant Force
Time moves in discrete steps.

ODT for frictionless motion
ODT For linear friction

Taylor Series expansion and Euler's method.
We also use Runge Kutta Method
We should also consider the squish of an object.
