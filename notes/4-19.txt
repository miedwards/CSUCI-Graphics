This will be on the final.

Bump mapping varies the apparent shape of a surface by altering
the surface normals.

Lighting calculations will use these modified normals and
produce the apparent bumpiness.

There are different ways to modify the normals. Usually a
texture map is sed to store the normals. A bump map
would specify a normal map and a height map.

These normals are taken from the colors of the texture map
Possibly from

2 * Blue / 256 -1.0

In order to do calculations with this, we need to convert lighting
and other relevant vectors into a tangent space, defined relative to
the point on the object. To do this, we need a rotation space.
We need the tangent and bi-tangent aligned with the bump map axes
the u and v, or s and t. To do this, we start with a triangle.
